🧾 Snowbird – Residency Day Tracker for State Tax Compliance
Primary Purpose:
Snowbird helps seasonal residents avoid surprise tax bills by tracking their time in each state — especially where the 183-day rule can trigger state tax residency.

Description:
Snowbird is a smart, location-aware financial tracker designed for snowbirds, remote workers, and dual-state homeowners. Whether you’re dodging winter or state income tax, Snowbird keeps tabs on your residency days, logs relevant expenses, and builds a bulletproof audit trail — all from your phone.

Now with an AI Personal Assistant, Snowbird goes beyond tracking: it helps you plan smarter, file faster, and stay compliant with ease.

Core Features:
📍 Residency Day Tracker – Auto-log or manually add days spent in each state using location data
🧮 183-Day Threshold Alerts – Real-time alerts as you approach state residency limits
💸 State-Based Expense Categorization – Tag purchases by location for audit-proof records
📝 Secure Residency Log – Journal housing, work, and travel details with timestamps
🔐 Private & Synced – End-to-end encrypted and synced across your devices

🤖 AI Snowbird Assistant –
Let your assistant do the thinking. Ask it to:

Generate summary reports for tax season

Find gaps in your travel log

Draft letters or documents in case of an audit

Recommend state-specific compliance tips based on your profile

Alert you to suspicious patterns or risk zones

Ideal For:
Snowbirds splitting time between states like AZ/NY, FL/CA, or TX/IL

High-income earners with multiple homes

Remote professionals avoiding unwanted residency

Anyone who wants clean, credible records without the spreadsheet mess

Why It Matters:
States like New York and California aggressively audit anyone who might owe them. Cross that 183-day line — even unintentionally — and you could be hit with a massive tax bill. Snowbird helps you prove where you were, how long you stayed, and why you don’t owe state income tax there.

Absolutely, here’s a Replit prompt tailored to help you build the AI-powered version of the Snowbird app, with a focus on adding the AI Personal Assistant feature:

🧠 Replit Prompt: Add AI Personal Assistant to Snowbird App

Build an AI-powered personal assistant module for the Snowbird – Residency Day Tracker app. The assistant should help users with tax residency compliance tasks using natural language interaction.

Project Requirements:
Core Functionality:

Integrate OpenAI's GPT API (or similar) for AI-driven conversations

Users can type or speak prompts like:

“How many days do I have left in California this year?”

“Summarize my Arizona expenses for March”

“Draft a non-residency affidavit for New York”

“Check if I crossed the 183-day rule in any state”

Return clear, user-friendly responses with relevant data

Data Access & Security:

Access logged location data, expense entries, and travel journal (from Firestore or app state)

Ensure the assistant only accesses and returns data tied to the authenticated user

Respect privacy: no OpenAI logging of personal data (use anonymization or secure proxying if needed)

UI Integration (Streamlit):

Create an “Ask Snowbird AI” chat window in the sidebar or dedicated tab

Support voice input if feasible using Web Speech API or similar

Show loading spinners and error handling gracefully

Bonus Features:

Add templated outputs (e.g., PDF exports for audit letters)

Proactive suggestions: “Hey, you’re 10 days away from NY’s 183-day threshold”

Summarize yearly data by state for tax filing

Tech Stack:

Python (Streamlit front-end)

Firebase (Firestore for state + Auth)

OpenAI API (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5)

Optional: Whisper API (for voice), PyPDF2 or ReportLab (for docs)
