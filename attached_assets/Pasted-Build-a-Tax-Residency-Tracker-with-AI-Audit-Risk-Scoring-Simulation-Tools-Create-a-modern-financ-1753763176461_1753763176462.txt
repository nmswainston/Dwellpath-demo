Build a Tax Residency Tracker with AI + Audit Risk Scoring + Simulation Tools
Create a modern financial tracking app called Snowbird that helps users monitor their tax residency days across multiple states. The app should track travel, expenses, risk exposure, and offer proactive insights through AI, while maintaining a beautiful and intuitive UI.

🔹 Primary Goals:
Help users avoid accidentally becoming tax residents in high-tax states (like CA, NY)

Provide financial & legal peace of mind with proactive tools and audit protection

Include a clean, professional dashboard UI like the one shown in the attached image
