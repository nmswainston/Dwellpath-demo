Replit Prompt: Polish the Existing Snowbird App for UI/UX and Feature Refinement
Improve and refine the existing Snowbird – Residency Tracker app. Maintain the current core functionality, but focus on polishing the design, improving usability, and making the app feel modern, responsive, and intuitive.

🔧 Objectives:
Polish UI Styling:

Apply a winter-inspired color palette (light blue, white, icy grays)

Ensure consistent font styling and button sizes

Add hover effects and tooltips for icons and data points

Improve mobile responsiveness across all pages

Enhance Dashboard Visuals:

Add icons or colored badges for state residency risk (e.g., green/yellow/red)

Include a timeline or calendar heatmap of tracked days per state

Use cards or tiles to display current status (e.g., “247 days tracked,” “$42,300 tax savings”)

Improve Sidebar Navigation:

Use icons + labels for clarity

Highlight the active tab

Collapse/expand support for mobile view

Refine Alerts & Notifications:

Make 183-day warning banners more visually distinct (light yellow or red with icon)

Allow dismissing or snoozing alerts

Add tooltips to explain the warning (e.g., “Why this matters”)

Audit Mode Polish:

Improve layout of logs, expenses, and journal entries for export

Format PDF output to be clean, timestamped, and CPA/auditor-friendly

Add export previews before download

Refine AI Assistant UI:

Position as a sidebar or tab with a friendly name (e.g., “Ask Snowbird AI”)

Add typing indicator and loading animation

Log past user queries with timestamps

Support summarizing user data into chat responses

Streamline Onboarding Flow:

Show a step-by-step wizard on first launch:

Set your home states

Set alert thresholds

Choose data sharing preferences

Use modal popups or progress indicators for clarity

General Improvements:

Fix any layout inconsistencies between pages

Add loading spinners where data fetches occur

Smooth out animation transitions between pages/views

Check for accessibility: color contrast, readable fonts, tab navigation

✅ Technologies to Use:
Streamlit for frontend

CSS modules or custom HTML where needed

Firebase (no changes needed unless performance bottlenecks)

Optional: use streamlit-extras, plotly, or streamlit-echarts for charts
